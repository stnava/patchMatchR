Description: Patch matching differs from models that are global and physical.
  This packages focuses on mapping patches or blocks over an image.  The patchMatch
  yields a local patch transformation and extracted patch without interpolating
  the original images.  Thus, the matches are similar to bounding boxes.  Quality
  information and spatial locations of matching points are also returned. Masks
  define the points over which we match.  In general, this is targeted at finding
  good sparse local matches between large domain images that may only partially
  correspond.
